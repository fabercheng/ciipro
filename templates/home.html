		<h3>What is CIIPro?</h3>
		<br>
        <p>
        Welcome to the Chemical <i>In vitro</i> - <i>In vivo</i> Profiling (CIIPro) project.  CIIPro is a cheminformatics web tool designed to
        link chemical features and <i>in vitro</i> biological data with targeted <i>in vivo</i> biological activity.  It was designed and developed by
        the <a href="http://zhu.camden.rutgers.edu/">Zhu Research Group</a> at Rutgers University in Camden, NJ.
        </p>


		<h3>How does CIIPro work?<br></h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        CIIPro automatically extracts the relevant public bioassay data for target compounds, constructs their biological profiles, and calculates
        biological similarity.  Currently the resulting <i>biological profiles</i> consist of biological assay data from PubChem only.
        Using CIIPro, the target compounds can be grouped based on their public bioassay testing results and compared to the target biological activity.
