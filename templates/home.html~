		<h3>What is CIIPro?</h3>
		</center>
		<br>
		Welcome to the chemical <i>In vitro</i>, <i>In vivo</i> Profiling (CIIPro) project.  CIIPro is a cheminformatics web tool designed to link chemical features, <i>in vitro</i> biological data with targeted <i>in vivo</i> biological activity.  It was designed and developed by the <a href="http://zhu.camden.rutgers.edu/">Zhu Research Group</a> at Rutgers University in Camden, NJ.<br>

		<h3>How does CIIPro work?<br></h3>
		</center>
		<br>
		CIIPro will use target compounds to automatically extract relevant public bioassay data, construct their biological profiles, and calculate biological similarity between every two compounds.  Currently the resulting <i>biological profiles</i> consist of biological assay data from PubChem only.  Using CIIPro, the target compounds can be grouped based on their public bioassay testing results and compared to the target biological activity.

We are always looking for feedback on the improvement of the web portal.
